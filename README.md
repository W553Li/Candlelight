Java roguelike game

This game was made with the usage/assistance of a coding tutorial series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9jRfgjV4FQ&list=PLWms45O3n--5vDnNd6aiu1CSWX3JlCU1n) made by RealTutsGML. Various game features such as the game-loop, rendering and tick method, entity bounds/hitboxes, shooting, etc. waere taken from the tutorial whereas other features such as the bosses, randomizers, gameplay-loop and certain controls were designed by myself.

All sprites used in the game were created by various creators from itch.io :
